# Auto_GUI_Control

This code is made to automate **Arduino Bootloading process**.

I had to use bootload large amount of ICs. So clicking button and navigating to the menu took lot of time. so I decided to automate that process by this code.

I used `pyautogui` library for this code

you can install it by running following command at cmd,

>pip install pyautogui

this python comes into handy to control gui applications. it contains lot of features. checkout their documentation for further details
